# Motivation

I've been sharing my Plex Server with family and friends for a while now. They quickly started to request everything they could think of through Overseerr, while not watching most of it. Since I use a modest server with limited capacity, I had to spend some time cleaning up after them.

With Maintainerr, i no longer have to keep an eye on their usage. And it has the added benefit of announcing media that's about to be deleted on the Plex home screen.
