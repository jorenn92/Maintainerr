# Maintainerr API docs

!!! danger
    :fire: :fire: The API, and all of Maintainerr for that matter, does not have an authentication method. There are certain API calls, that if you make your instance public facing, will expose your entire settings configuration. This could include all of your service's API keys. Proceed with extreme caution if you choose to expose Maintainerr to the public. :fire: :fire:

## API endpoints

This API documentation is a work in progress. For the time being, its usefulness is in showing the endpoints and URL parameters. Moving forward, expected responses will also be included.
